# Final Notes
This is made for server owners to improve their server bots anti-spam, not for using it on servers to troll and be toxic on.


Its also another reason for discord to improve their anti-spam, such as cool down for typing the same word more than 5 times.
Discord really needs to work on their anti-spam, so look at this as almost a tool for Discord to improve with.

If i find out its being using for toxic reasons I'll remove it or if discord asks me too.
