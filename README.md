Edit Channel ID to the servers channel.

Edit Server ID to the servers ID.

Edit DirPictures with your folder location.

# Auto Server Joining
You must have Google Chrome installed.

this does not work for tokens, only email and passwords.

put your email and pass into the token slot in the config file or create a file called tokens.txt.

The format for the email and pass is "email@gmail.com-:-password" without quotes.


# Final Notes
This is made for server owners to improve their server bots anti-spam, not for using it on servers to troll and be toxic on.


Its also another reason for discord to improve their anti-spam, such as cool down for typing the same word more than 5 times.
Discord really needs to work on their anti-spam, so look at this as almost a tool for Discord to improve with.

If i find out its being using for toxic reasons I'll remove it or if discord asks me too.
